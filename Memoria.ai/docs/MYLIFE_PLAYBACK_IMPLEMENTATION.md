# My Life Tab - Audio Playback Implementation

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented inline audio playback controls for the My Life tab, resolving the critical UX issue where users could only see Alert dialogs instead of playing their memory recordings.

**Implementation Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Complete
**Testing Status:** Integration tests written (requires Jest setup to run)

---

## Problem Statement

### Original Issue
When users tapped on a memory item in the My Life tab, they encountered:
- An Alert dialog showing memory details
- No way to play the audio recording
- Dead-end user experience

The playback functionality existed but was isolated in the `RecordingsList` component, accessible only from the `SimpleRecordingScreen` modal via a list icon button.

### User Impact
- Elderly users couldn't easily play their memories from the main My Life screen
- Navigation was confusing (required opening recording screen first)
- Disconnected UX between memory viewing and playback

---

## Solution Overview

### Architecture Decision: Inline Playback Controls

After analyzing three options:
- **Option A:** Navigate to RecordingsList modal
- **Option B:** Inline playback in memory cards (SELECTED)
- **Option C:** Standalone playback screen

**Selected Option B because:**
1. **Direct Interaction:** Users tap a memory and immediately see playback controls
2. **Visual Continuity:** Controls expand within the same card, reducing cognitive load
3. **Elderly-Friendly:** Large touch targets, clear visual feedback, minimal navigation
4. **Maintainable:** Extracted shared playback logic into reusable hook

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Shared Audio Playback Hook

**File:** `/Users/lihanzhu/Desktop/Memoria/Memoria.ai/hooks/useAudioPlayback.ts`

**Features:**
- Centralized audio playback state management
- Reusable across multiple components
- Handles play/pause, skip forward/backward (15s), seeking
- Automatic cleanup on unmount
- Haptic feedback integration

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
export function useAudioPlayback() {
  return {
    // State
    playingId,           // ID of currently playing memory
    playbackPosition,    // Current position in milliseconds
    playbackDuration,    // Total duration in milliseconds
    isPlaying,          // Boolean play/pause state

    // Controls
    togglePlayPause,    // (id: string, audioPath: string) => Promise<void>
    stopPlayback,       // () => Promise<void>
    skipBackward,       // () => Promise<void> - Skip 15s back
    skipForward,        // () => Promise<void> - Skip 15s forward
    seekToPosition,     // (position: number) => Promise<void>
  };
}
```

### 2. Updated My Life Tab Screen

**File:** `/Users/lihanzhu/Desktop/Memoria/Memoria.ai/app/(tabs)/mylife.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Imported and initialized `useAudioPlayback` hook
2. Modified `handleMemoryPress` to toggle playback instead of showing Alert
3. Enhanced `renderMemoryItem` to show two states:
   - **Compact View:** Play icon, duration, date (default state)
   - **Expanded View:** Progress bar, time display, playback controls (when playing)

**UI Components Added:**
- Progress bar with real-time position indicator
- Time display (current / total)
- Three control buttons:
  - Rewind 15 seconds
  - Play/Pause (large center button)
  - Forward 15 seconds

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Waveform icon indicator for memories with audio
- Card elevation increases when expanded
- Color-coded progress bar using theme tint color
- Smooth transitions between compact and expanded states

### 3. Refactored RecordingsList Component

**File:** `/Users/lihanzhu/Desktop/Memoria/Memoria.ai/components/RecordingsList.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Replaced local playback state with `useAudioPlayback` hook
- Removed duplicate playback logic (100+ lines)
- Updated function calls to use shared hook
- Maintains same UX, now with shared state management

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for playback state
- Consistent behavior across components
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier to maintain and debug

## Technical Specifications

### State Management
```typescript
// Shared playback state (useAudioPlayback hook)
playingId: string | null           // Currently playing memory ID
playbackPosition: number           // Position in milliseconds
playbackDuration: number           // Total duration in milliseconds
isPlaying: boolean                 // Play/pause state
playingSound: Audio.Sound | null   // Expo Audio.Sound instance
```

### Audio Configuration
```typescript
// Sound creation
Audio.Sound.createAsync(
  { uri: audioPath },
  { shouldPlay: true }
)

// Playback status updates
sound.setOnPlaybackStatusUpdate((status) => {
  if (status.isLoaded) {
    setPlaybackPosition(status.positionMillis);
    setPlaybackDuration(status.durationMillis || 0);
    setIsPlaying(status.isPlaying);

    if (status.didJustFinish) {
      // Cleanup and reset
    }
  }
});
```

### Skip Controls Logic
```typescript
// Skip backward (15 seconds, clamped to 0)
const newPosition = Math.max(0, currentPosition - 15000);

// Skip forward (15 seconds, clamped to duration)
const newPosition = Math.min(duration, currentPosition + 15000);
```

- Uses native MediaPlayer through Expo
- Haptic feedback via Vibrator
- Material icons fallback
- Audio focus management

### Shared
- Same UX across platforms
- Theme-aware colors
- Responsive touch targets
- Consistent timing (15s skip intervals)

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Management**
   - Audio unloaded immediately when switching memories
   - Cleanup on component unmount
   - No memory leaks from dangling Sound objects

2. **State Updates**
   - Throttled progress updates (based on Audio.Sound updates)
   - Minimal re-renders through targeted state updates
   - Memoized callbacks in hook

3. **UI Rendering**
   - Conditional rendering (compact vs expanded)
   - No unnecessary re-renders of non-playing cards
   - Optimized FlatList rendering

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Background Playback:** Not implemented (requires additional Expo Audio configuration)
2. **Playback Speed Control:** Not included in current version
3. **Scrubbing:** No direct progress bar interaction (future enhancement)
4. **Audio Visualization:** Static waveform icon only (real-time visualization not implemented)
