## The Bottom Line (TL;DR)

### Recommendation
**Build a web app, but NOT NOW. Wait 9-12 months post-launch.**

### Why?
1. Current priority: Get Apple approval and launch mobile
2. Need to validate product-market fit first (100+ users, 40%+ retention)
3. Solo developer can't maintain two platforms pre-launch
4. Building web now = wasted effort if mobile product fails

### When?
**Revisit Decision**: Q3 2026 (September 2026) after achieving mobile success

### How Much?
- **Web MVP (Read-Only)**: $30K-40K, 4 months
- **Full Web Features**: $50K-60K, 6 months
- **Total**: $80K-100K over 10 months
- **Annual Maintenance**: +$16K/year (vs. mobile-only)

### Decision Triggers (Build When You Hit 2 of 3)
1. 30%+ of mobile users request web access
2. 100+ MAU with 40%+ retention on mobile
3. $100K+ funding OR second developer hired
