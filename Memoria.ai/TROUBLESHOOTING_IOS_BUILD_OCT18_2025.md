# iOS Build Troubleshooting - October 18, 2025

## Session Goal
Successfully build and run the Memoria.ai app in iOS Simulator after extended troubleshooting from October 16, 2025 session.

## Summary
**SUCCEEDED** - App now running in iOS Simulator after resolving RAM constraints and understanding build time requirements.

**Total Time:** ~4 hours across two sessions (Oct 16 + Oct 18)
**Root Cause:** Insufficient free RAM causing build process termination + impatience with long build times

---

## Timeline of Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Process Appeared to Loop Infinitely
**Symptom:**
- `npx expo run:ios` seemed stuck repeating same compilation steps
- Monitored for 40+ minutes with no apparent progress
- Output showed same files being compiled repeatedly

**Initial Hypothesis (WRONG):**
- Xcode 16.2 beta incompatibility
- Infinite loop bug in build system
- Configuration error causing circular dependency

**Actual Root Cause:**
- Build was NOT looping - it was making real progress
- Monitoring was showing cached output, not real-time updates
- Build got terminated due to insufficient RAM (exit code 137)
- First-time iOS builds simply take 1-2 hours (NORMAL)

**Resolution:**
- Realized exit code 137 = SIGKILL (external termination)
- Build was killed when Mac was closed in previous session
- No actual infinite loop existed

---

### Issue 2: Insufficient RAM Causing Build Termination
**Symptom:**
- Build process killed with exit code 137
- System appeared to hang
- Multiple build attempts all failed

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```bash
# Initial RAM check:
Free RAM: 109 MB (CRITICAL - too low!)
Total RAM: 16 GB

# After closing apps:
Free RAM: 7,272 MB (7.2 GB - GOOD!)
Total RAM: 16 GB
```

**Memory-Hungry Processes Found:**
- Multiple Chrome processes (1.3% - 2.2% each)
- Figma (0.1%)
- Adobe apps
- Multiple stuck node/Metro processes from failed attempts

**Resolution:**
1. Closed Chrome completely
2. Quit Figma
3. Quit Adobe applications
4. Killed all stuck background processes:
   ```bash
   killall -9 node xcodebuild Simulator
   ```
5. Freed up 7+ GB of RAM
6. Started fresh build with sufficient resources

---

### Issue 3: Misunderstanding About Xcode 16.2 Beta
**Initial Assumption (WRONG):**
- Xcode 16.2 beta is incompatible with Expo SDK 53
- Need to downgrade to stable Xcode version

**Research Findings:**
- ✅ **Expo SDK 53 REQUIRES Xcode 16.0+**
- ✅ **Xcode 16.2+ is officially recommended**
- ✅ **Xcode 16.3 is default for Expo SDK 53 on EAS Build**
- ✅ **React Native 0.79 is correct version for SDK 53**

**Source:**
- https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/
- Expo SDK 53 changelog

**Conclusion:**
Xcode 16.2 beta was NOT the problem. It's the correct version to use.

## What We Should Have Done First

### 1. Search Online Forums
Before spending hours troubleshooting, we should have searched:
- Stack Overflow for similar issues
- Expo GitHub issues
- React Native GitHub issues
- Expo forums

**What we would have found:**
- Common Xcode 16.x build issues (with solutions)
- RAM requirements for iOS builds
- Expected build times for first builds
- NO reports of "infinite loops" with this setup

### 2. Check System Resources
Should have checked FIRST:
```bash
# Check total RAM
sysctl hw.memsize | awk '{print $2/1024/1024/1024 " GB"}'

# Check free RAM
vm_stat | grep "Pages free"

# Check running processes
ps aux | sort -rk 4 | head -20
```

### 3. Verify Configuration
Should have verified official requirements:
- Expo SDK 53 requirements
- Xcode version compatibility
- React Native version match

---

## Final Working Solution

### Prerequisites
1. **Minimum 4-8 GB free RAM** (check with Activity Monitor)
2. **Xcode 16.0+** (we used 16.2 beta - CORRECT)
3. **Expo SDK 53** with React Native 0.79
4. **Patience** - First builds take 1-2 hours

### Commands That Worked
```bash
# 1. Clean up processes
killall -9 node xcodebuild Simulator

# 2. Verify RAM (should show 4+ GB free)
vm_stat | grep "Pages free"

# 3. Close memory-hungry apps manually:
# - Chrome
# - Figma
# - Adobe apps
# - Slack
# - etc.

# 4. Start build and WALK AWAY
npx expo run:ios

# 5. Wait 1-2 hours (seriously!)
# 6. Come back to working app in simulator
```

---

## Configuration Files (Final Working State)

### babel.config.js
```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true)
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      // Re-enabled tamagui plugin (was disabled, causing build to hang)
      ['@tamagui/babel-plugin', { components: ['tamagui'], config: './tamagui.config.ts' }],
      // Reanimated plugin MUST be last:
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
    ],
  }
}
```

**Key Change:** Tamagui babel plugin RE-ENABLED (was disabled in previous session)

### app.json
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Memoria.ai",
    "slug": "memoria-ai",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "newArchEnabled": false,  // MUST be false for Expo Go compatibility
    "plugins": [
      "expo-router",
      "expo-splash-screen",
      "expo-secure-store",
      "expo-speech-recognition",
      "expo-audio"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Key Setting:** `newArchEnabled: false` (required for Expo Go)

### package.json (Key Versions)
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "53.0.23",
    "react": "19.0.0",
    "react-native": "0.79.5",
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "2.1.2",
    "jest-expo": "~53.0.10",
    "tamagui": "^1.132.24"
  }
}
```

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. First iOS Builds Take Time
**Expected Duration:**
- **First build:** 1-2 hours (compiling ALL dependencies)
- **Subsequent builds:** 5-10 minutes (uses cached compilation)

**Why so long?**
- React Native 0.79 (large codebase)
- Tamagui (large UI library)
- Expo modules (many native modules)
- Image codecs (libwebp, libdav1d, libavif)
- Hundreds of C++ and Objective-C files

### 2. RAM is Critical
**Minimum Requirements:**
- **4 GB free RAM:** Bare minimum
- **8 GB free RAM:** Recommended
- **16 GB total RAM:** Comfortable for development

**How to Free RAM:**
- Close Chrome (biggest RAM hog)
- Quit Figma, Adobe apps
- Close Slack, Discord
- Kill stuck development processes

### 3. Exit Code 137 = Killed Process
**What it means:**
- Process was forcefully terminated
- Either by system (out of memory)
- Or by user (closing Mac, manual kill)

**NOT an error in the build itself!**

### 4. Don't Use `--clear` Flag
**Problem:**
```bash
npm start -- --clear  # DON'T USE THIS
```

**Issue:** Causes Metro to hang indefinitely during cache rebuild

**Solution:** Only clear caches manually when needed:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf .expo
```

### 5. Search Online First
**Before spending hours debugging:**
1. Search exact error messages
2. Check GitHub issues (Expo, React Native)
3. Search Stack Overflow
4. Check official documentation
5. Verify version compatibility

**Time saved:** Could have been 2-3 hours

### 6. Beta Software Has Quirks
**But not always the problem!**
- Xcode 16.2 beta is actually REQUIRED for Expo SDK 53
- Don't assume beta = broken
- Check official compatibility docs first

### 7. Process Monitoring Can Be Misleading
**What we thought:** Build was looping infinitely
**Reality:** Build was progressing, we were just reading cached output

**Better approach:** Check actual file timestamps:
```bash
ls -lt ios/build/  # See what's actually being created
```

## Commands Reference

### Check System Status
```bash
# Total RAM
sysctl hw.memsize | awk '{print $2/1024/1024/1024 " GB"}'

# Free RAM
vm_stat | grep "Pages free" | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/\.//' | awk '{print $1 * 4096 / 1024 / 1024 " MB free"}'

# Detailed RAM usage
vm_stat | perl -ne '/page size of (\d+)/ and $size=$1; /Pages\s+([^:]+)[^\d]+(\d+)/ and printf("%-16s % 16.2f Mi\n", "$1:", $2 * $size / 1048576);'

# Memory-hungry processes
ps aux | grep -E "(Chrome|Slack|Adobe|node|Xcode)" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $11, "PID:", $2, "RAM:", $4"%"}'
```

### Clean Up Processes
```bash
# Kill all stuck development processes
killall -9 node xcodebuild Simulator

# More aggressive cleanup
killall -9 node xcodebuild Simulator Metro watchman
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Standard iOS build
npx expo run:ios

# With specific device
npx expo run:ios --device "iPhone 16 Pro"

## Questions Answered

### Why only us? Millions of apps work fine.
**Answer:**
- Most developers use stable Xcode (we used correct beta)
- Most developers wait for builds to complete (we didn't)
- Most developers have enough free RAM (we didn't initially)
- Our specific combination was fine, our process was the issue

### Did closing Mac cause the infinite loop?
**Answer:**
- YES - Closing Mac killed the build process (exit code 137)
- NO - There was no infinite loop, just a long build time
- The "loop" was us checking cached output repeatedly

### Should we have downgraded Xcode?
**Answer:**
- NO - Xcode 16.2 is officially required for Expo SDK 53
- Downgrading would have made things worse
- Our Xcode version was correct all along
