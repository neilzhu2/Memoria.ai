# Transcription Implementation Log

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete (Mock Implementation), Native Module Integration Pending

## Summary

Implemented automatic transcription feature for voice recordings in the Memoria.ai app. Users can now record audio, and the system will automatically transcribe the audio content into editable text.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. UI/UX Flow Improvements

#### EditMemoryModal.tsx
- **Removed duplicate transcription sections** - Had two transcription displays (read-only and editable)
- **Removed Tags section entirely** - Simplified UI per user requirements
- **Renamed "Description" to "Transcription"** - Field now shows auto-generated transcription
- **Updated state management:**
  - Changed `description` state to `transcription`
  - Updated initialization to populate from `memory.transcription` or fallback to `memory.description`
  - Modified save logic to save as `transcription` instead of `description`
- **Improved placeholder text:** "Transcription will appear here automatically..."

#### SimpleRecordingScreen.tsx
- **Added transcription service integration:**
  - Imported `getTranscriptionService` from transcription service
  - Created `transcribeRecording()` function to handle transcription after save
  - Modified `saveRecording()` to trigger transcription in background
  - Updates both storage and UI state when transcription completes

#### RecordingContext.tsx
- **Fixed critical bug:** `addMemory()` was returning `void` instead of the created `MemoryItem`
  - Updated return type: `Promise<void>` → `Promise<MemoryItem>`
  - Added `return newMemory;` statement
  - This fix enables the EditMemoryModal to receive the saved memory object

## Technical Architecture

### Transcription Flow

```
1. User records audio → stops → clicks "Save"
2. Memory saved to AsyncStorage with audio path
3. EditMemoryModal opens immediately (user can edit title)
4. [Background] Transcription service processes audio
5. When complete, transcription updates:
   - Memory in storage (via updateMemory)
   - savedMemory state (modal shows transcription live)
6. User sees transcription appear automatically
```

### Services Used

**Transcription Service** (`services/transcription/`)
- `TranscriptionService.ts` - Main service with provider pattern
- `ExpoSpeechProvider.ts` - Uses expo-speech-recognition (on-device, free, offline)
- `ITranscriptionProvider.ts` - Interface for pluggable providers

**Benefits of Architecture:**
- Privacy-friendly (on-device processing)
- Works offline
- No API costs
- Optimized for elderly users (slower speech patterns)

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Native Module Not Found
**Error:** `Cannot find native module 'ExpoSpeechRecognition'`

**Cause:** expo-speech-recognition requires native iOS code, needs Xcode build

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ✅ Ran `npx expo prebuild --clean` to generate native iOS/Android folders
2. ✅ Installed CocoaPods via Homebrew
3. ❌ `npx expo run:ios` build failed with Xcode error code 65

**Current Workaround:** Mock transcription implementation (see below)

### Issue 2: Bundle Cache
**Problem:** Metro bundler was serving old cached code with removed variables (`tagsInput`, `description`)

**Solution:** Needed app reload after code changes

---

## Mock Implementation (Current)

Since native build failed, implemented **mock transcription** for testing:

```typescript
// In SimpleRecordingScreen.tsx
const transcribeRecording = async (memory: MemoryItem) => {
  try {
    console.log('Starting mock transcription for memory:', memory.id);

    // Simulate processing delay
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

    // Mock transcription text
    const mockTranscript = `This is a mock transcription of your recording about: ${memory.title}. In a production environment, this would contain the actual speech-to-text conversion of your audio recording.`;

    // Update memory with mock transcription
    await updateMemory(memory.id, {
      transcription: mockTranscript,
    });

    // Update UI state
    setSavedMemory(prev => prev ? { ...prev, transcription: mockTranscript } : null);

    console.log('Mock transcription complete');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Mock transcription failed:', error);
  }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Can test complete user flow
- UI updates work correctly
- Can refine UX before tackling native build

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2)
1. ✅ Commit current progress with mock implementation
2. Test complete recording flow with mock transcription
3. Gather user feedback on UI/UX
4. Make UI improvements based on feedback

### Future (Phase 3 - Real Transcription)
1. **Debug Xcode build failure** - Investigate error code 65 in detail
2. **Alternative approaches:**
   - Option A: Use Expo Go development build with expo-speech-recognition
   - Option B: Try EAS Build for managed workflow
   - Option C: Consider alternative transcription service (e.g., Whisper API, cloud-based)
3. **Test on physical device** - Speech recognition may work better on real hardware
4. **Performance optimization** - Ensure transcription doesn't block UI

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `components/SimpleRecordingScreen.tsx` - Recording flow + transcription trigger
- `components/EditMemoryModal.tsx` - Display + edit transcription
- `contexts/RecordingContext.tsx` - Fixed addMemory return type

### Services (Ready for real implementation)
- `services/transcription/TranscriptionService.ts` - Already implemented
- `services/transcription/ExpoSpeechProvider.ts` - Already implemented
- `services/transcription/ITranscriptionProvider.ts` - Already implemented

### Configuration
- `ios/` folder created via prebuild (native project)
- `android/` folder created via prebuild (native project)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Expo + Native Modules = Complex**
   - Managed Expo workflow is simpler but limits native modules
   - Bare workflow requires Xcode/Android Studio builds
   - Development builds (expo-dev-client) may be better middle ground

2. **Mock First, Then Real**
   - Implementing mock allowed us to validate UI flow
   - Can iterate on UX without wrestling with native builds
   - Easier to test and get user feedback

3. **State Management Critical**
   - Small bug in RecordingContext (missing return) broke entire flow
   - Live UI updates require careful state synchronization
   - Background operations need proper state updates

4. **Bundle Caching Issues**
   - Metro bundler caches aggressively
   - Need app reloads after significant code changes
   - `--clear` flag helps but not always sufficient

## Testing Checklist

### Current (With Mock)
- [ ] Record audio → Save → EditMemoryModal opens
- [ ] Mock transcription appears after 2 seconds
- [ ] Transcription is editable
- [ ] Can save edited transcription
- [ ] Transcription persists after app restart
- [ ] Title field still required
- [ ] Audio playback works in EditMemoryModal

### Future (With Real Transcription)
- [ ] Real speech-to-text accuracy
- [ ] Handles different accents/speech patterns
- [ ] Works with elderly users' speech speed
- [ ] Offline functionality

✅ **Memory Preservation** - Searchable text from voice recordings
✅ **Editing Capability** - Can correct transcription errors
✅ **Privacy** - On-device processing (when real implementation done)
✅ **Offline** - No internet required (when real implementation done)
✅ **Free** - No API costs (when using expo-speech-recognition)
