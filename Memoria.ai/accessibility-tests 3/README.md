npm run accessibility:report
```

### 3. Manual Testing

1. Follow the **Manual Testing Checklist**: `manual-testing/accessibility-checklist.md`
2. Use recommended tools from **Tools Guide**: `tools/accessibility-tools-guide.md`
3. Test with real elderly users using **User Testing Protocol**: `user-testing/elderly-user-testing-protocol.md`

## 🧪 Testing Approach

### Automated Testing (Daily)
- **Component-level accessibility tests** for all UI components
- **Integration tests** for complete user journeys
- **Performance tests** on various device configurations
- **WCAG compliance checking** with axe-core
- **Screen reader compatibility** validation

### Manual Testing (Weekly)
- **Touch target size verification** (minimum 60px for elderly users)
- **Font size and contrast testing** at various zoom levels
- **Screen reader navigation** with VoiceOver and TalkBack
- **Motor accessibility testing** with simulated hand tremors
- **Cognitive load assessment** for interface complexity

### User Testing (Monthly)
- **Elderly user sessions** with participants aged 65-85
- **Bilingual testing** with Chinese-speaking users
- **Family dynamics testing** with multi-generational scenarios
- **Cultural appropriateness evaluation**
- **Assistive technology compatibility** with real users

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: 100% target
- **Task Completion Rate**: 95% for core functions by elderly users
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.2/5.0 average rating
- **Touch Target Accuracy**: 95% successful touches
- **App Launch Time**: <3 seconds on 3-year-old devices

### Elderly User-Specific Metrics
- **First-Time Success Rate**: 85% of users complete key tasks without assistance
- **Learning Curve**: 80% user competency within 3 sessions
- **Error Recovery**: 90% successful error recovery without support
- **Family Integration**: 75% successful family member onboarding

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Touch targets too small
**Solution**: Use `getCurrentTouchTargetSize()` from settings store, minimum 60px

**Issue**: Chinese text rendering poorly
**Solution**: Use recommended Chinese fonts, test at various sizes, ensure proper spacing

**Issue**: Screen reader navigation confusing
**Solution**: Check semantic structure, add proper labels, test navigation order

**Issue**: Performance slow on older devices
**Solution**: Implement performance optimizations, reduce animations, optimize memory usage
