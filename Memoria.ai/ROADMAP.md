**Core Value Proposition**:
- Dead-simple audio recording (one tap to start)
- Warm, accessible UI optimized for elderly users
- Cultural sensitivity (Chinese family values, bilingual support)
- Family sharing with respect for hierarchy
- Privacy-first approach (user data isolation)

---

## 📍 Current Status (Nov 9, 2025)

### ✅ MVP Complete - Core Features Working

**What's live**:
- User registration and authentication
- Audio recording and playback
- Memory CRUD (create, read, update, delete)

- User data isolation (privacy secured)
- Dark/Light theme support
- Session persistence

**Tech stack**:
- Expo Go (development environment)

### 🌟 Phase 5: Family Sharing MVP (Feb-Mar 2026)
**Goal**: Enable simple family memory sharing

**Core User Flow**:
1. User A (Grandpa) creates family group, invites User B (Grandson)
2. User B requests topic: "Tell me about the war"
3. User A sees request, records memory about that topic
4. User A shares memory with family → B can view/listen
5. User A can unshare or edit later

- ✅ `topic_requests` - Requested topics
- ✅ `memory_shares` - Shared memories

**Implementation**:
- Simplify code from `future-features/components/FamilySetup/`
- Simplify code from `future-features/components/MemorySharing/`
- Use existing database schema (created in Phase 1)

**NOT included** (archived as too complex):
- ❌ Family hierarchy/roles

- ❌ Elder approval workflows
- ❌ Generation-specific sharing

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks

**Decision process**:
1. Launch Phase 5 family sharing
2. Collect user feedback
3. Identify most-requested features
4. Prioritize based on user needs

**NOT planned** (archived as too complex):
- ❌ Family hierarchy/roles
- ❌ Cultural respect levels
- ❌ Elder approval workflows

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks (based on user demand)
