# SDK 54 Upgrade Troubleshooting - October 18, 2025

## Goal
Run Memoria.ai app on physical iPhone using Expo Go after successfully getting iOS Simulator working.

## Timeline of Events

### Step 1: Chose Expo Go Approach
**Decision:** Use Expo Go (Option 1) instead of Development Build (Option 2)
**Reasoning:** Fastest way to test on physical iPhone without rebuild

### Step 2: Started Metro Bundler
**Command:**
```bash
npm start -- --localhost --ios
```

**Result:**
- Metro bundler started successfully
- QR code generated for Expo Go app
- Connection available at exp://192.168.1.83:8081

### Step 3: SDK Version Mismatch Discovered
**Error:** "Project is incompatible with this version of Expo Go"
**Details:**
- Expo Go app on iPhone: SDK 54.0.0
- Memoria.ai project: SDK 53
- Expo Go cannot run older SDK versions

**Screenshot:** User provided screenshot showing incompatibility error

### Step 4: Upgraded to SDK 54
**Command executed:**
```bash
npx expo install expo@latest
```

**Package changes:**
- expo: 53.0.23 → 54.0.13
- react-native: 0.79.5 → 0.81.4
- react: 19.0.0 → 19.1.0
- react-native-reanimated: ~3.17.4 → ~4.1.1
- Many other dependency updates

**Installation issues:**
- Initial `npm install` showed peer dependency conflicts
- Used `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to bypass

### Step 5: New Error - Missing react-native-worklets
**Error:** "Cannot find module 'react-native-worklets/plugin'"

**Full error details:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'react-native-worklets/plugin'
Require stack:
- /Users/lihanzhu/Desktop/Memoria/Memoria.ai/node_modules/babel-preset-expo/build/index.js
- /Users/lihanzhu/Desktop/Memoria/Memoria.ai/node_modules/@babel/core/lib/config/files/plugins.js
```

**Symptom:**
- Metro bundler starts but fails during JavaScript compilation
- Error occurs when processing expo-router entry point
- Babel cannot find required plugin

**Screenshot:** User provided screenshot showing full error stack trace

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Error Occurred

**Research findings from online sources:**

1. **Reanimated v4 Dependency Change**
   - React Native Reanimated v4 (included in SDK 54) introduced a new architecture
   - `react-native-worklets` is now a REQUIRED peer dependency
   - Previous versions (v3) did not require this package

2. **babel-preset-expo expects the plugin**
   - SDK 54's babel-preset-expo automatically adds 'react-native-worklets/plugin'
   - This plugin is essential for Reanimated v4 worklets compilation
   - Package was not automatically installed during expo upgrade

3. **Why didn't it auto-install?**
   - `npx expo install expo@latest` only updates expo package
   - It doesn't automatically run `npx expo install --fix` to update all dependencies
   - We manually ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` which bypassed peer dependency resolution

### Sources
- Stack Overflow: Multiple reports of same error after SDK 54 upgrade
- Expo GitHub Issues: Known issue tracked in expo/expo repository
- React Native Reanimated docs: v4 migration guide mentions worklets requirement

## Strategic Options Analysis

### Option 1: Install react-native-worklets (Move Forward with SDK 54)

**Commands:**
```bash
npx expo install react-native-worklets
# This will install the correct version compatible with SDK 54
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fixes current error and unblocks Expo Go testing
- ✅ Keeps us on latest SDK (54) with newest features
- ✅ Simple one-package installation
- ✅ Most commonly recommended solution in community forums
- ✅ No babel.config.js changes needed (handled by preset-expo)

**Cons:**
- ❌ SDK 54 is newer, less battle-tested than SDK 53
- ❌ May encounter other SDK 54 compatibility issues later
- ❌ Requires thorough testing of all app features after upgrade

**Risk Level:** LOW - Well-documented solution, many apps successfully upgraded

**Time Estimate:** 5 minutes (install + restart Metro)

---

### Option 2: Rollback to SDK 53 (Return to Known Working State)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Revert all package.json changes
git checkout HEAD -- package.json package-lock.json

# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Restart Metro
npm start
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Returns to known working configuration (iOS Simulator worked perfectly)
- ✅ Avoids any SDK 54 unknowns
- ✅ More stable, battle-tested SDK version
- ✅ Safer option if we want to avoid risks

**Cons:**
- ❌ CANNOT use Expo Go on iPhone (SDK mismatch persists)
- ❌ Physical device testing still blocked
- ❌ Will eventually need to upgrade to SDK 54 when Expo Go updates
- ❌ Doesn't solve the original goal (test on iPhone)

**Risk Level:** VERY LOW - Returning to working state

**Time Estimate:** 10 minutes (rollback + reinstall + restart)

---

### Option 3: Build Development Client (Bypass Expo Go Entirely)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Rollback to SDK 53 first
git checkout HEAD -- package.json package-lock.json
npm install

# Build custom development client for iPhone
npx expo run:ios --device
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Bypasses SDK version matching requirement
- ✅ Can use SDK 53 (known working) on physical device
- ✅ More control over native modules
- ✅ Closer to production build experience

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires 1-2 hour build time (like we experienced today)
- ❌ Needs USB cable connection to iPhone
- ❌ More complex setup than Expo Go
- ❌ Slower iteration cycle for testing

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Long build time, but known process

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours (build + install on device)

---

### Option 4: Stay on SDK 54 but Downgrade Reanimated to v3

**Commands:**
```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated@~3.17.4
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Keeps SDK 54 (allows Expo Go)
- ✅ Avoids react-native-worklets requirement
- ✅ Reanimated v3 is stable and well-tested

**Cons:**
- ❌ Creates version mismatch (SDK 54 expects Reanimated v4)
- ❌ May cause other compatibility issues
- ❌ Not officially supported configuration
- ❌ Will likely fail `npx expo-doctor` checks

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Unsupported configuration, likely to cause issues

**Time Estimate:** 15 minutes (but may lead to more issues)

## Current State (Awaiting Decision)

### What's Working
- ✅ iOS Simulator - App runs perfectly
- ✅ Build system - No RAM issues, builds complete successfully
- ✅ Git repository - All work committed and pushed
- ✅ Metro bundler - Starts up (but fails on worklets import)

### What's Blocked
- ❌ Expo Go on iPhone - SDK 54 requires react-native-worklets package
- ❌ Metro compilation - Cannot bundle JavaScript without worklets

### What We Need to Decide
Which option to pursue based on:
1. **Time available** - Do we have 5 minutes or 2 hours?
2. **Risk tolerance** - Prefer stable (SDK 53) or latest (SDK 54)?
3. **Testing needs** - Simulator only or must test on iPhone?
4. **Long-term strategy** - Will we upgrade to SDK 54 eventually anyway?

---

## Next Steps (Once Decision Made)

### If Option 1 Chosen (Install Worklets):
```bash
# 1. Install missing package
npx expo install react-native-worklets

# 2. Kill current Metro process
killall -9 node

# 3. Restart Metro bundler
npm start -- --localhost --ios

# 4. Open Expo Go on iPhone and scan QR code

# 5. Verify app loads and all features work
```

### If Option 2 Chosen (Rollback to SDK 53):
```bash
# 1. Revert package changes
git checkout HEAD -- package.json package-lock.json

# 2. Clean reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# 3. Restart Metro
npm start

# 4. Return to iOS Simulator testing
# 5. Defer iPhone testing until SDK 54 is more stable
```

### If Option 3 Chosen (Development Build):
```bash
# 1. Rollback to SDK 53
git checkout HEAD -- package.json package-lock.json
npm install

# 2. Connect iPhone via USB

# 3. Build development client
npx expo run:ios --device

# 4. Wait 1-2 hours for build

# 5. Test on physical device
```

## Questions to Consider

1. **Is testing on iPhone critical RIGHT NOW?**
   - If YES → Option 1 (install worklets, try SDK 54)
   - If NO → Option 2 (rollback, stick with simulator)

2. **How much time do we have today?**
   - If 5-10 minutes → Option 1 or 2
   - If 1-2 hours → Option 3 possible

3. **How important is stability vs. latest features?**
   - If stability critical → Option 2 (SDK 53)
   - If want latest → Option 1 (SDK 54)

4. **When will we upgrade to SDK 54 eventually?**
   - If soon anyway → Option 1 (do it now)
   - If not for months → Option 2 (defer)
