# SDK 54 Upgrade - SUCCESS - October 18, 2025

## Goal Achieved
‚úÖ Successfully upgraded to SDK 54 and app now running on physical iPhone via Expo Go

## Summary
After encountering the `react-native-worklets` missing module error, we successfully:
1. Installed the missing package
2. Started Metro bundler with SDK 54
3. Connected physical iPhone via Expo Go
4. App now running on both iOS Simulator (development build) AND physical iPhone (Expo Go)

---

## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Identified Missing Dependency
**Error:** `Cannot find module 'react-native-worklets/plugin'`

**Root cause:**
- Expo SDK 54 includes React Native Reanimated v4
- Reanimated v4 requires `react-native-worklets` package
- Package was not automatically installed during SDK upgrade

### Step 2: Installed react-native-worklets
```bash
# Initial attempt failed due to peer dependency conflicts
npx expo install react-native-worklets
# Error: ERESOLVE could not resolve (peer dependency conflicts)

# Solution: Use legacy peer deps (same as SDK upgrade)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# SUCCESS: Added 3 packages
```

**Package added:**
- `react-native-worklets@0.5.1`

### Step 3: Restarted Metro Bundler
```bash
# Kill all stuck node processes
killall -9 node

# Start Metro bundler (without --ios flag to avoid simulator prompt)
npm start
```

**Result:**
- Metro bundler started successfully
- No more "Cannot find module" errors
- Server listening on port 8081
- Ready to accept connections

### Step 4: Connected iPhone via Expo Go
**Connection details:**
- Mac IP address: `192.168.1.83`
- Metro server: `http://localhost:8081`
- Expo Go URL: `exp://192.168.1.83:8081`

**Steps:**
1. Opened Expo Go app on iPhone (SDK 54 version)
2. Tapped "Enter URL manually"
3. Entered: `exp://192.168.1.83:8081`
4. App loaded successfully on physical device

## Current Configuration

### Package Versions (SDK 54)
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^54.0.13",
    "react": "19.1.0",
    "react-native": "0.81.4",
    "react-native-reanimated": "~4.1.1",
    "react-native-worklets": "0.5.1",
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "2.2.0",
    "jest-expo": "53.0.10"  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Should be ~54.0.12 (not critical)
  }
}
```

### babel.config.js
```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true)
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      ['@tamagui/babel-plugin', { components: ['tamagui'], config: './tamagui.config.ts' }],
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',  // Must be last
    ],
  }
}
```

**Note:** The `react-native-worklets/plugin` is automatically added by `babel-preset-expo` when it detects the package is installed. No manual babel config needed.

### app.json
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Memoria.ai",
    "slug": "memoria-ai",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "newArchEnabled": false,  // Required for Expo Go compatibility
    "plugins": [
      "expo-router",
      "expo-splash-screen",
      "expo-secure-store",
      "expo-speech-recognition",
      "expo-audio"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Development Environments Now Available

### 1. iOS Simulator (Development Build) ‚úÖ
**How to run:**
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

**Characteristics:**
- Uses custom development build
- Includes all native modules compiled into app
- Slower to rebuild (5-10 min for code changes, 1-2 hours for native changes)
- Most production-like environment
- Good for testing native module integration

**When to use:**
- Testing native module functionality
- Verifying production-like behavior
- Testing before actual release

### 2. Physical iPhone (Expo Go) ‚úÖ
**How to run:**
```bash
npm start
# Then connect via Expo Go app: exp://192.168.1.83:8081
```

**Characteristics:**
- Uses Expo Go runtime (no custom native code)
- Fast refresh (instant code changes)
- Over-the-air updates
- Limited to Expo-supported modules only
- Good for rapid UI/UX iteration

**When to use:**
- Daily development and iteration
- Quick UI/UX testing
- Immediate feedback on code changes
- Testing on real device without rebuilds

---

## Workflow Comparison

### OLD Workflow (Pre-SDK 54, Simulator Only)
```
Change code ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Simulator auto-refreshes (via Metro)
```

**Environment:**
- iOS Simulator with development build
- Metro bundler running
- Fast Refresh enabled

### NEW Workflow (SDK 54, Multiple Devices)

#### Option A: Continue Using Simulator (Development Build)
```bash
# One-time: Build was already done earlier today
# Already running in simulator from earlier build

# Make code changes ‚Üí Save
# Simulator auto-refreshes (via Metro from development build)
```

**Metro server:** Must be started via `npm start` or is running from `npx expo run:ios`

#### Option B: Use Physical iPhone (Expo Go) - RECOMMENDED FOR ITERATION
```bash
# Metro bundler already running from: npm start
# iPhone connected via Expo Go

# Make code changes ‚Üí Save
# iPhone auto-refreshes (via Metro + Expo Go)
```

**Advantages:**
- Instant refresh on real device
- Test with actual touch interactions
- See real performance
- Camera, microphone work (for recording feature!)

#### Option C: Use BOTH Simultaneously
```bash
# Metro bundler running: npm start
# Simulator running: npx expo run:ios (in separate terminal)
# iPhone connected: exp://192.168.1.83:8081 in Expo Go

# Make code changes ‚Üí Save
# BOTH devices auto-refresh simultaneously!
```

**When useful:**
- Testing responsive design across screen sizes
- Comparing performance
- Ensuring cross-device compatibility

## Key Differences in Development Workflow

### What STAYS THE SAME ‚úÖ
1. **Fast Refresh** - Code changes still auto-refresh
2. **Metro Bundler** - Same bundler serves both environments
3. **Hot Module Replacement** - Same instant updates
4. **Debugging** - Can still use React DevTools, console logs
5. **Your editing workflow** - Make changes, save, see results

### What CHANGES üîÑ

#### 1. Starting the Development Server
**Before (Simulator only):**
```bash
npx expo run:ios  # Builds + starts Metro + opens simulator
```

**Now (Multiple options):**
```bash
# Option 1: Just Metro (for iPhone Expo Go)
npm start

# Option 2: Development build (for Simulator)
npx expo run:ios

# Option 3: Both at once
# Terminal 1: npx expo run:ios (simulator)
# Terminal 2: npm start (iPhone can connect to same Metro)
```

#### 2. When Native Code Changes
**Expo Go (iPhone):**
- ‚ùå Cannot handle custom native modules
- ‚ùå Requires sticking to Expo SDK modules only
- ‚úÖ No rebuild needed for supported modules

**Development Build (Simulator):**
- ‚úÖ Supports ANY native module
- ‚ùå Requires full rebuild when native code changes
- ‚úÖ Production-equivalent environment

**Example:**
If we add a new native module (like `react-native-camera`):
- Simulator: Need to run `npx expo run:ios` again (10-60 min)
- iPhone: Won't work in Expo Go (would need development build on iPhone too)

#### 3. Testing Real Device Features
**Expo Go (iPhone):**
- ‚úÖ Real microphone (for your recording feature!)
- ‚úÖ Real camera
- ‚úÖ Real touch/gestures
- ‚úÖ Real notifications
- ‚úÖ Actual device performance

**Simulator:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Simulated microphone (may behave differently)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No camera (uses sample images)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mouse clicks (not real touch)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Push notifications limited

## Recommended Development Workflow Going Forward

### For Daily Iteration (90% of work)
**Use iPhone + Expo Go:**
```bash
# Start once in the morning:
npm start

# Then all day:
# 1. Make code changes in editor
# 2. Save file
# 3. iPhone auto-refreshes
# 4. Test feature on real device
# 5. Repeat
```

**Benefits:**
- Fastest iteration cycle
- Real device testing
- No rebuild delays
- Perfect for UI/UX work

### For Native Module Testing (10% of work)
**Use Simulator + Development Build:**
```bash
# When you need to:
# - Add new native module
# - Test production behavior
# - Verify native integration

npx expo run:ios

# Wait 5-10 min for rebuild
# Test in simulator
```

### For Pre-Release Testing
**Use BOTH:**
```bash
# Test on simulator (production-like)
npx expo run:ios

# Test on physical device (real hardware)
npm start  # Connect iPhone via Expo Go

# Later: Build actual development client for iPhone
npx expo run:ios --device
```

---

## Important Considerations

### 1. Metro Bundler Must Be Running
Both environments need Metro:
- Simulator (development build): Can auto-start Metro or use existing
- iPhone (Expo Go): Needs `npm start` running on Mac

**Check if Metro is running:**
```bash
lsof -i :8081 | grep LISTEN
```

### 2. Same WiFi Network Required (for iPhone)
- Mac and iPhone must be on same WiFi
- IP address: `192.168.1.83` (can change if WiFi changes)
- Firewall must allow port 8081

### 3. Code Changes vs Native Changes

**JavaScript/TypeScript changes (instant refresh):**
- Component updates
- UI styling
- Business logic
- State management
- Navigation changes

**Native changes (require rebuild):**
- New native modules
- app.json changes (some)
- Native plugin configuration
- iOS permissions (Info.plist)

### 4. Expo Go Limitations
**What works in Expo Go:**
- All Expo SDK modules (audio, camera, storage, etc.)
- Standard React Native components
- JavaScript libraries
- Tamagui (UI library)

**What DOESN'T work in Expo Go:**
- Custom native modules (not in Expo SDK)
- Modified native code
- Custom native plugins

**For Memoria.ai:** Everything should work since we only use Expo SDK modules!

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ **Done:** App running on iPhone via Expo Go
2. üì± **Recommended:** Use iPhone + Expo Go as primary development environment
3. üñ•Ô∏è **Optional:** Keep simulator available for quick checks
4. üìù **Optional:** Update other package versions to SDK 54 (jest-expo, etc.)

### When You Want to Code
```bash
# Morning routine:
npm start

# Connect iPhone:
# - Open Expo Go
# - Scan QR code OR enter exp://192.168.1.83:8081

# Then code all day with instant refresh!
```

### When You Need to Rebuild
**Only necessary when:**
- Adding new native dependencies
- Changing app.json native configuration
- Testing production build
- Preparing for release

```bash
# Simulator rebuild:
npx expo run:ios

# iPhone rebuild (development client):
npx expo run:ios --device  # Requires USB cable
```

### When You're Ready to Release
```bash
# Build production app for App Store
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Or local build:
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### iPhone Can't Connect
**Check:**
1. Both on same WiFi network
2. Metro bundler running (`npm start`)
3. Correct IP address (check with `ifconfig`)
4. Firewall not blocking port 8081
5. Expo Go app updated to SDK 54

### Simulator Won't Refresh
**Solutions:**
1. Press `Cmd + D` in simulator ‚Üí "Reload"
2. Restart Metro: Kill node processes, run `npm start`
3. Clear cache: `rm -rf .expo node_modules/.cache`
4. Rebuild: `npx expo run:ios`

### Changes Not Appearing
**Check:**
1. File actually saved
2. Metro bundler connected (green "Connected" in terminal)
3. No syntax errors (check Metro logs)
4. Fast Refresh enabled (shake phone ‚Üí "Enable Fast Refresh")

## Summary

### What Changed Today
- ‚úÖ Upgraded from SDK 53 ‚Üí SDK 54
- ‚úÖ Installed react-native-worklets for Reanimated v4
- ‚úÖ App now runs on iPhone via Expo Go
- ‚úÖ Maintained simulator development build

### What to Do Differently
**Daily development:**
- Use iPhone + Expo Go (faster, real device)
- Run `npm start` once, code all day
- Instant refresh on every save

**When needed:**
- Use simulator for production-like testing
- Rebuild only when adding native modules
- Both environments can run simultaneously

### What Stays the Same
- Code editing workflow
- Fast refresh
- Hot module replacement
- Debugging tools
- Git workflow

**Session Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
**Duration:** ~1 hour (SDK 54 upgrade + Expo Go setup)
**Outcome:** App running on both iOS Simulator (dev build) AND physical iPhone (Expo Go)

**Key Takeaway:** You now have TWO development environments - use iPhone + Expo Go for daily iteration (fastest workflow), and simulator for production-like testing when needed. The workflow remains largely the same: edit code, save, auto-refresh. The main difference is WHERE you're testing (real device vs simulator).
