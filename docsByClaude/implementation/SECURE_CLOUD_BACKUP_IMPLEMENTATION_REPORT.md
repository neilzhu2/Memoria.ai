## 2. Security Implementation

### 2.1 Encryption Service Enhancement

**File**: `/src/services/encryptionService.ts`

#### Key Features:
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 120,000 iterations (optimized for mobile devices)
- **Enhanced Entropy**: Additional randomness for elderly users
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic rotation every 90 days
- **Hardware Security**: Integration with device secure enclaves when available

#### Elderly-Friendly Enhancements:
```typescript
// Enhanced entropy for elderly users
const additionalEntropy = elderlyMode ? crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16)) : new Uint8Array(0);

// Elderly-friendly password generation
async generateSecurePassword(length = 32, elderlyFriendly = true): Promise<string> {
  if (elderlyFriendly) {
    // Generate pronounceable password segments: "bef3-koz7-vup9-leg2"
    const consonants = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz';
    const vowels = 'aeiou';
    const numbers = '23456789'; // Exclude 0,1 to avoid confusion
    // ... implementation details
  }
}
```

#### Security Measures:
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each backup uses a unique encryption key
- **Integrity Protection**: HMAC verification for all encrypted data
- **Key Escrow Protection**: No key recovery possible without user master password
- **Secure Deletion**: Cryptographic key destruction for data erasure

### 2.2 Authentication Service

**File**: `/src/services/authenticationService.ts`

#### Multi-Factor Authentication Options:
1. **Biometric Authentication** (Primary)
   - Fingerprint recognition
   - Face ID/recognition
   - Iris scanning (where available)
   - Elderly-friendly prompts and fallbacks

2. **SMS Verification** (Secondary)
   - 6-digit codes (easier for elderly users)
   - Rate limiting and attempt tracking
   - Clear phone number formatting

3. **Emergency Access** (Tertiary)
   - Family member emergency requests
   - 48-hour waiting period with notifications
   - Secure contact verification

#### Elderly-Specific Features:
```typescript
// Longer session timeouts for elderly users
this.config.autoLockMinutes = elderlyMode ? 30 : 15;

// Less friction for backup operations
this.config.requireAuthForBackup = elderlyMode ? false : true;

// Clear, non-technical prompts
const authPrompt = elderlyFriendly
  ? 'Please place your finger on the sensor to access your memories'
  : 'Authenticate to access your cloud backup';
```

### 2.3 Zero-Knowledge Implementation

The system ensures that:
- **No plaintext data** ever leaves the user's device
- **Encryption keys** are derived from user passwords and never transmitted
- **Cloud provider** cannot decrypt user data under any circumstances
- **Metadata protection** through client-side anonymization
- **Forward secrecy** through key rotation and perfect forward secrecy
