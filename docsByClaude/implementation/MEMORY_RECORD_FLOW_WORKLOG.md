# Memory Recording Flow Implementation Work Log

## Project: Memoria.ai UX Implementation
**Start Date:** 2025-09-21
**Status:** Phase 1 - In Progress
**Current Task:** Transform home screen layout to match wireframes

## Implementation Plan Overview

Based on wireframe analysis (`/Users/lihanzhu/Desktop/Memoria/Product&Design/Wireframe_Memory-record Experience.pdf`), the complete implementation is divided into 5 phases:

### **Phase 1: Home Screen Layout (Current Phase)**
- [ ] Task 1: Update header section to match wireframe design
- [ ] Task 2: Implement quick stats cards (Memory count, family members, recent activity)
- [ ] Task 3: Add bottom navigation bar (Home, Memories, Family, Settings tabs)
- [ ] Task 4: Style main recording button to match wireframe positioning
- [ ] Task 5: Test layout in simulator for elderly-friendly sizing

### **Phase 2: Recording Flow Screens**
- [ ] Task 6: Create recording preparation screen ("Ready to record?" with instructions)
- [ ] Task 7: Build active recording interface (Visual feedback, timer, waveform)
- [ ] Task 8: Implement recording completion modal (Save/discard with previews)
- [ ] Task 9: Add recording success confirmation ("Memory saved!" with actions)
- [ ] Task 10: Test complete recording flow transitions

### **Phase 3: Memory Management**
- [ ] Task 11: Build "My Memories" list screen (Grid/list view with thumbnails)
- [ ] Task 12: Create memory detail/playback screen (Play, edit, share, delete)
- [ ] Task 13: Implement memory organization (Categories, favorites, search)
- [ ] Task 14: Add bulk management options (Select multiple, batch operations)
- [ ] Task 15: Test memory browsing experience and accessibility

### **Phase 4: Settings & Family Features**
- [ ] Task 16: Create settings screen layout (Accessibility, audio, sharing)
- [ ] Task 17: Build family sharing interface (Add members, permissions)
- [ ] Task 18: Implement notification preferences (Family alert settings)
- [ ] Task 19: Add account/profile management (User info, backup)
- [ ] Task 20: Test all settings functionality for elderly users

### **Phase 5: Polish & Final UX**
- [ ] Task 21: Add smooth page transitions (Fade, slide animations)
- [ ] Task 22: Implement loading states (Progress indicators, skeletons)
- [ ] Task 23: Add haptic feedback patterns (Different vibrations per action)
- [ ] Task 24: Polish voice guidance (Consistent audio cues)
- [ ] Task 25: Final accessibility review (VoiceOver, contrast validation)

## Development Guidelines

### **Elderly-Friendly Design Requirements**
- Large touch targets (80px+ minimum)
- High contrast colors (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- Clear, readable fonts (18-32px sizes)
- Simple, intuitive navigation
- Voice guidance for all actions
- Haptic feedback confirmation

### **Technical Stack**
- React Native with Expo SDK
- TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for state management
- React Query for data fetching
- expo-av for audio recording
- expo-speech for voice guidance
- expo-haptics for tactile feedback

### **Testing Strategy**
- **QA-First Development**: @mobile-qa-engineer writes unit tests for ALL tasks before implementation
- **Test Lock Policy**: Once tests are written by QA engineer, NO other agents can modify them
- **Pass-All-Tests Requirement**: All work must pass 100% of QA tests before completion
- Continuous testing in iOS Simulator after each task
- Controlled, iterative development
- User feedback collection after each phase
- Accessibility testing with VoiceOver

### **Agent Assignment Policy**
- **Maximize Agent Usage**: Assign specialized agents for every possible task
- **Parallel Agent Execution**: Run multiple agents concurrently when possible
- **QA-First Workflow**: Always start with @mobile-qa-engineer for test creation
- **Expert Specialization**: Use domain-specific agents (fullstack-react-engineer, expo-typescript-engineer, etc.)

### **Development Guidelines - Locked Pages Policy**
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Do not modify pages we have nailed down without explicit permission**
- **Locked Pages**: Home screen, MyLife tab (including Profile segment), Navigation structure
- **Permission Required**: Any agent suggesting changes to locked pages must get user approval first
- **Exception**: Only proceed without permission if there are strong technical reasons that benefit elderly users
- **Process**: Share suggested changes with user for approval before implementation
- **Rationale**: Prevents regression on completed, tested user experiences
