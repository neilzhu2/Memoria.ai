## 5. Special Considerations for Screening

### Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines

**For Chinese-Speaking Participants:**
- Begin with formal greetings and show respect for age and wisdom

- Understand that direct "no" answers may be culturally difficult
- Be prepared to explain research benefits to family members
- Respect hierarchical decision-making processes

**For Technology-Anxious Participants:**
- Emphasize that no prior technology experience is required
- Reassure that they can't "break" anything or do anything wrong
- Offer to have family members present for support
- Explain that the goal is to learn from them, not test them
- Use encouraging and patient tone throughout screening

### Accessibility Accommodation Planning

**For Vision-Related Needs:**

### Capacity Assessment Protocols

**If Cognitive Concerns Arise:**
