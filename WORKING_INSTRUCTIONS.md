   - Update todo list completion status
   - Record next session priorities clearly

### After Every Work Session:

1. **Update Project Guide**
   - Add progress update section with date
   - Update current status and next actions
   - Record any decisions made with rationale
   - Update metrics if applicable

2. **Document Code Changes**
   - Commit messages should reference elderly user benefits
   - Include accessibility considerations in PR descriptions
   - Tag commits with feature areas (audio, accessibility, ux, etc.)

3. **Track User Research Insights**
   - Document any elderly user feedback received
   - Note accessibility improvements made
   - Record cultural considerations addressed

## üéØ Decision Making Framework

### For Technical Decisions:
1. **Elderly User Impact**: How does this affect our target demographic?
2. **Accessibility First**: Does this maintain or improve accessibility?
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Is this appropriate for Chinese-speaking users?
4. **Performance Impact**: How does this affect app performance for older devices?
5. **Maintenance Burden**: Can this be maintained long-term?

### For UX Decisions:
1. **Simplicity Test**: Can a 70-year-old use this without confusion?
2. **Cultural Appropriateness**: Is this respectful across cultures?
3. **Family Involvement**: How does this affect multi-generational usage?
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: Does this meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards?
5. **Engagement Balance**: Does this encourage without overwhelming?

## üîß Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements:
- **TypeScript strict mode** for all new code
- **Accessibility props** on all interactive elements
- **Error boundaries** for graceful failure handling
- **Performance monitoring** for elderly device support
- **Internationalization** from day one

### Testing Requirements:
- **Accessibility testing** with screen readers
- **Performance testing** on older devices
- **Cultural testing** with bilingual content
- **Elderly user testing** for all major features
- **Family workflow testing** for sharing features

## üìä Metrics Tracking

### Always Monitor:
- **Performance metrics**: App startup time, memory usage
- **Accessibility compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA adherence
- **User engagement**: Recording frequency, session duration
- **Error rates**: Failed recordings, app crashes
- **Cultural metrics**: Chinese vs English usage patterns

### Report Weekly:
- Progress against Phase milestones
- User research insights collected
- Technical debt accumulated
- Accessibility improvements made
- Cultural adaptation progress
